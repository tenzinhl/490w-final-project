CSE 490W Final Project notes:

Book on decoding ADS-B. Note: use introduction for physical layer
  https://mode-s.org/decode/index.html

^Guy's github also has a library for this

rtl-sdr guide on ADS-B decoding: https://www.rtl-sdr.com/adsb-aircraft-radar-with-rtl-sdr/

Repo for decoding NRSC-5 digital radio stations:
https://github.com/theori-io/nrsc5

Sort of provides hints as to how to get stereo FM?

Refresher on FM principles:

Streaming spectrogram
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11874767/how-do-i-plot-in-real-time-in-a-while-loop-using-matplotlib

I think at this point my goals are:
- Stream FM audio using my own demodulation code
- Stream the spectrogram
- STRETCH: add a UI
