# CSE 490W Final Project Log:

## Purpose

To log what I'm doing as I do it. The goal is to make the final report easier.

## The log

Before: Much stressing about project. Bouncing between FM audio streaming, ADS-B
decoding, and NOAA satellite decoding.

### 5/12:

Working on recording audio from SDRSharp and then figuring out how to work
it in Python.

Already wrote an example for simple audio files. I/Q recordings use up MUCH disk
space. 

### 5/15:

Working on extracting data from SDRSharp IQ files. Conclusion: samples are
signed (makes sense as this matches the AF files). Also discovered that
sounddevice doesn't even let you play arrays where the dtype is unsigned lol.

Note: while graphing IQ recording from SDRSharp there's a noticeably MASSIVE
spike at the center. Based on internet searches this is why you'd want to check
the "correct IQ" box in SDRSharp.

### 5/16

Yessss, finally got FM decoding out of SDRSharp recording working :letsgooo:.

### 5/22

Oh boy apparently I took a week long break??
Probably just forgot to log for a while.

So something I want to figure out is whether changing name of file prevents
SDRSharp playback. I think it might :/

Okay nvm you can do it. It's just that it derives the center frequency etc. from
the name so if you rename it'll break that.

Add spectrogram graphing utility. Open wav file.

## Monday 5/23

Writing to WAV file...

YESSS GOT playback working in SDRSharp!!

Added squelching to fmdemod

Ate my own dogfood

Alright next thing is trying some IQ correction.

I should plan to add a "recording" class/struct
which has the necessary stuff for finding the
file and doing appropriate playback (instead
of multiple hardcoded constants).

## Tuesday 5/24

Trying to understand the weirdness of SDRSharp's baseband recording.

Screenshots saved. Basically quality is HORRIBLE unless you use 32-bit float. But my thing shows 16-bit is more than enough for good fidelity. So what's going on? It seems like something is wrong with the gain?

Ahhh yes, seems like it had to do with Tuner AGC being set.

Beginning to work on recordings.py interface

# Wednesday 5/25

Wrap up recordings.py (I think this is good?)

# Thursday 5/26

Work on WAV file writer

Work on FFT graphing function
