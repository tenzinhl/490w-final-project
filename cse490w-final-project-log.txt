# CSE 490W Final Project Log:

## Purpose

To log what I'm doing as I do it. The goal is to make the final report easier.

## The log

Before: Much stressing about project. Bouncing between FM audio streaming, ADS-B
decoding, and NOAA satellite decoding.

### 5/12:

Working on recording audio from SDRSharp and then figuring out how to work
it in Python.

Already wrote an example for simple audio files. I/Q recordings use up MUCH disk
space. 

### 5/15:

Working on extracting data from SDRSharp IQ files. Conclusion: samples are
signed (makes sense as this matches the AF files). Also discovered that
sounddevice doesn't even let you play arrays where the dtype is unsigned lol.

Note: while graphing IQ recording from SDRSharp there's a noticeably MASSIVE
spike at the center. Based on internet searches this is why you'd want to check
the "correct IQ" box in SDRSharp.

### 5/16

Yessss, finally got FM decoding out of SDRSharp recording working :letsgooo:.

### 5/22

Oh boy apparently I took a week long break??
